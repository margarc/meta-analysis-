Begg and Mazumdar (1994) 
The function carries out the rank correlation test as described in Begg and Mazumdar (1994). 
The test can be used to examine whether the observed outcomes and the corresponding sampling variances are correlated. 
An asymmetric funnel plot would give rise to such a correlation and may be indicative of publication bias. The function is actually a wrapper for the cor.test function with method="kendall". 
If possible, an exact p-value is provided; otherwise, a large-sample approximation is used.

x	
An object of class meta or estimated treatment effect in individual studies.
seTE	
Standard error of estimated treatment effect (mandatory if x not of class meta).
method.bias	
A character string indicating which test is to be used. Either "rank", "linreg", "mm", "count", "score", or "peters", can be abbreviated.
plotit	
A logical indicating whether a plot should be produced for method.bias "rank", "linreg", "mm", or "score".
correct	
A logical indicating whether a continuity corrected statistic is used for rank correlation methods "rank" and "count".
k.min	
Minimum number of studies to perform test for funnel plot asymmetry.


Egger’s test: report
Z statistic (p value)

>"Publication bias was assessed by screening funnel plots for any asymmetry and by using the Egger regression test16 for analyses of more than three studies.
p values less than 0·1 were deemed to correspond with significant asymmetry"- Xiao 2016 

<0.1 instead of 0.05

>consider sequencial removbal of studies that are outside the 95% CIs of the funnel plot (as a sensitivity analysis).
To possibly see if there is any effect on reducing heterogeneity. Main results should still be presented with all studies.
>changing level of significance? <0.1 instead of <0.05.....
