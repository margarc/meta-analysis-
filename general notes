binary variables can only take two possible values 

generalisability of results* 
-age
-country of origin (most frm middle & high income)


Confounder (three criteria):
1. Must be associated with the study exposure
2. Must be a risk factor for a disease in the absence of the study exposure 
3. Must NOT be a consequence of the exposure (i.e. not in the causal pathway between exposure and disease)
* It can lead to overestimating or underestimating the true association between exposure and disease an can even change the 
direction of the observed effect. 


Bias: Incorrect estimate of the measure of effect either toward or away from the null. 
It will lead to inaccurate results. 
Confounding can lead to bias 


*Observational studies are subject to the limitations of: chance, confounding, bias 




# Baujat plot (what is this?) : a graph of the influence of individual studies on beta coefficients versus its relative contribution 
# to the pooled heterogeneity estimate . . . 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Define heterogeneity: when there is more variation in the results than would be expected by chance alone. 
>that could be the consequence of: clinical, methodological or statistical variation

How to check for it? 
>Visually: forest plot how much do individual studies overlap with each other and the summary effect 
>Stats tests: chi squared tests for heterogeneity (Cochran Q test): Tests whether the individual effects are farther away from the
common effect, beyond what is expected by chance
> I-squared: % of total variability in effect measure that is attributable to heterogeneity (i.e. not to chance)

Cox Proportional-Hazards Regression for Survival Data in R
Survival analysis examines and models the time it takes for events to occur. Use the survival package in R to estimate Cox regressions.
Survival analysis typically examines the relationship of the survival distribution to covariates. Most
commonly, this examination entails the specification of a linear-like model for the log hazard.
