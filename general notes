binary variables can only take two possible values 

generalisability of results* 
-age
-country of origin (most frm middle & high income)


Confounder (three criteria):
1. Must be associated with the study exposure
2. Must be a risk factor for a disease in the absence of the study exposure 
3. Must NOT be a consequence of the exposure (i.e. not in the causal pathway between exposure and disease)
* It can lead to overestimating or underestimating the true association between exposure and disease an can even change the 
direction of the observed effect. 


Bias: Incorrect estimate of the measure of effect either toward or away from the null. 
It will lead to inaccurate results. 
Confounding can lead to bias 


*Observational studies are subject to the limitations of: chance, confounding, bias

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Define heterogeneity: when there is more variation in the results than would be expected by chance alone. 
>that could be the consequence of: clinical, methodological or statistical variation

*How to check for it? 
>Visually: forest plot how much do individual studies overlap with each other and the summary effect 
>Stats tests: chi squared tests for heterogeneity (Cochran Q test): Tests whether the individual effects are farther away from the
common effect, beyond what is expected by chance
> I-squared: % of total variability in effect measure that is attributable to heterogeneity (i.e. not to chance)

Fixed effects model: Inverse-variance, Peto method, M-H method
-Assumes there is no statistical heterogeneity among the studies

Random effects model: DerSimonian & Laird method
-Allows for random error plus inter-study variability
-Studies tend to be weighted more equally (relatively more weight is given to smaller studies).
-Wider confidence interval for the summary estimate and, larger p-value

Cox Proportional-Hazards Regression for Survival Data in R
Survival analysis examines and models the time it takes for events to occur. Use the survival package in R to estimate Cox regressions.
Survival analysis typically examines the relationship of the survival distribution to covariates. Most
commonly, this examination entails the specification of a linear-like model for the log hazard.

Funnel plots to examine bias in meta-analysis note:

Relative measures of treatment effect (risk ratio or odds ratios) are plotted on a logarithmic scale. 
This is important to ensure that effectsn of the same magnitude but opposite directions for example risk ratios of 0.5 and 2 
are equidistant from 1 (corresponding to no effect).

Prevalence meta-analysis 

Peto and Mantel-Haenszel methods aren't appropriate for prevalence.
1. Obtain raw proportions and sample sizes (cases) from each paper. 
2. Calculating confidence intervals binomial wilson
3. Transform the proportions using the Freeman Turkey method (arcsin).
>Install packages: meta ((Author: Guido Schwarzer); metafor ((Author: Wolfgang Viechtbauer); rmeta ( (Author: Thomas Lumley). 

"An effect size could be almost any summary statistic (e.g. a mean, a difference in proportions, an adjusted odds ratio, etc.)
Conventional meta-analytic models assume normality of ESs. Because of the CLT, this will holds for most ESs given large enough samples.
To normalize ESs: a log-transform is common.
# Effect size calculation
# Using metafor For ES Calculation
Syntax ES <- escalc(endpoints, variances, measure, data, ...) 
endpoints: arguments or formula containing endpoint values 
variances: arguments containing endpoint variances 
measure: character value indicating type of ES 
data: data frame containing named variables

Modeling Approaches:

Fixed
-> Same mean ES, zero between-study variance
Random
-> Different mean ES, between-study variance
Mixed
-> Study-level regression for mean ES
*The Random effects model can be used to infer what would likely happen if a new study were performed, the FE model cannot

*Note: the log is taken of the relative risk and the odds ratio, which makes these outcome
measures symmetric around 0 and helps to make the distribution of these outcome measure
closer to normal

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Meta-regression requires the estimated treatment eect, its variance, and covariate values for each trial in the systematic review. 
A common reason for not being able to undertake meta-regression is that these are not all available. 
Any analysis can only be based on the subset of trials for which full information happens to be available, potentially biasing the results.

*small samples -> large SE -> wide Conf intervals -> high p-values

Funnel plot-choice of axis (Sterne & Egger 2001)
"...evaluated standard error, precision (inverse of standard error), variance, inverse of variance, sample size and log
sample size (vertical axis) and log odds ratio, log risk ratio and risk difference (horizontal axis).
-conclude that funnel plots of meta-analyses should generally use standard error as the measure of study size and ratio measures 
of treatment effect"

*With the standard error plotted on the vertical axis, emphasis of the plot is on smaller studies where bias is more likely. 
Axis has to be invereted so that larger trials are placed at the top of the graph. 

*pseudo 95% confidence limits in funnel plots ...
Q: names of studies corresponding to each funnel plot dot?

Q: How can I import a particular dataset from excel to R without needing to copy in a different excel document!?!
Try
datasets <- readxl_example("datasets.xlsx")
read_excel(datasets)
# Specify sheet either by position or by name
read_excel(datasets, 2)
read_excel(datasets, "mtcars")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
packages dplyr, tidyr, and broom: to create a table in R and export in word (try it)

Remember use NOS_adapted for crosss sectional studies

AB:
# To save R workspace with all objects to use at a later time:
save.image(file=R_session_saved_image, compress='gzip') --test
---------------------------------------------

*Influence analysis: meta-analysis estimates (pooled estimates) are computed omitting one study at a time (...)
