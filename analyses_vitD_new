Prevalence meta-analysis 
Peto and Mantel-Haenszel methods aren't appropriate for prevalence.
1. Obtain raw proportions and sample sizes (cases) from each paper. 
2. Calculating confidence intervals binomial wilson
3. Transform the proportions using the Freeman Turkey method (arcsin).
>Install packages: meta ((Author: Guido Schwarzer); metafor ((Author: Wolfgang Viechtbauer); rmeta ( (Author: Thomas Lumley). 
"An effect size could be almost any summary statistic (e.g. a mean, a difference in proportions, an adjusted odds ratio, etc.)
Conventional meta-analytic models assume normality of ESs. Because of the CLT, this will holds for most ESs given large enough samples.
To normalize ESs: a log-transform is common.
