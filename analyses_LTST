# Egger's test linear regression
metabias(metap1, method="linreg")
And how to interpret this:
# Null-hypothesis: no bias in a meta-analysis 
# Assumption of test: Linearity still holds in the presence of bias
# Again for this test use the metabias functgion of the R package meta like this:
# example: >metabias (ms1, method="linreg")

Example with explanation from a previous analysis:
data:  mort1
t = 3.927, df = 9, p-value = 0.003474
alternative hypothesis: asymmetry in funnel plot
sample estimates:
    bias   se.bias     slope 
1.682775  0.428511 -0.905780 
 * so in this case Eggers test shows a significant p-value (0.0035) which is less than 0.05 and thus this leads to rejecting the null 
 hypothesis of symmetry in the funnel plot; so asymmetric (evid of publ bias?)
