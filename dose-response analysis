# Dose-response models: regression models where the independent variable is usually referred
to as the dose or concentration and the dependent variable is usually referred to as response or effect.
e.g. plasma or serum selenium = independent variable
     risk of advanced prostate cancer = dependent variable (for example presented by relative risks)
     
In a dose response meta-analysis, the assigned dose is typically the median or midpoint value. 

#Installed package: "dosresmeta"
library("dosresmeta")
# The data cc_ex is included in the "dosresmeta" package from the paper: Case-control study used by Greenland and Longnecker (1992) 
on alcohol consumption (grams/day) and breast cancer risk.

Using alcohol_crc data from package "dosresmeta"

R> lin <- dosresmeta(formula = logrr ~ dose, id = id, type = type, se = se,
+ cases = cases, n = peryears, data = alcohol_crc)
R> summary(lin)
