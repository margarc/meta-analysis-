# Dose-response models: regression models where the independent variable is usually referred
to as the dose or concentration and the dependent variable is usually referred to as response or effect.
e.g. plasma or serum selenium = independent variable
     risk of advanced prostate cancer = dependent variable (for example presented by relative risks)
     
In a dose response meta-analysis, the assigned dose is typically the median or midpoint value. 

#Installed package: "dosresmeta"
library("dosresmeta")
# The data cc_ex is included in the "dosresmeta" package from the paper: Case-control study used by Greenland and Longnecker (1992) 
on alcohol consumption (grams/day) and breast cancer risk.

Using alcohol_crc data from package "dosresmeta"

Command to do the dose response analysis:
> lin <- dosresmeta(formula = logrr ~ dose, id = id, type = type, se = se, cases = cases, n = peryears, data = alcohol_crc)
e.g. lin <- dosresmeta(formula = logrr ~ dose, id = id, type = type, se = se, cases = cases, n = peryears, data = alcohol_crc)

> summary(lin)
RESULT:

Call:  dosresmeta(formula = logrr ~ dose, id = id, type = type, cases = cases, 
    n = peryears, data = alcohol_crc, se = se)

Two-stage random-effects meta-analysis

* From result of this example we say that: we found a significant log-linear dose-response association between  alcohol consumption 
and colorectal cancer risk (p <0.001) and no evidence of heterogeneity across studies (Q= 4.78, P - VALUE= 0.6868).
The change in colorectal cancer risk associated with every 12 grams/day (standard drink) can
be obtained with the predict function. 

>predict(lin, delta = 12, exp = TRUE)

Result:
dose pred ci.lb ci.ub
12 1.080313 1.0465 1.115218

So we say: Every 12 grams/day increase in alcohol consumption was associated 
with a significant 8.0% (95% CI = 1.05, 1.12) increased risk of colorectal cancer.
