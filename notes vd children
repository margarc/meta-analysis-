# STUDIES 
I wrote: "Five (Rey 14; Ponnarmeni 16; Onwuneme 15; Hebbar 14; Korwu 15) used additional control grps for comparisons" 
-A. commented: what does this mean?- 
so did i correctly identify these 5 as cohort vs case-control studies 
#
In Summary table written as:
#
Rey et al 2014	
Cohort, (single centre) 	
n= 156 less than 16 years old 
Control group: n= 289 healthy children  
#
Ponnarmeni et  al 2016	
Cohort, (single centre) 	
n= 124 critically ill with sepsis, 1-12 years of age  admitted between January and December 2012
Control group: n= 338 Healthy for baseline variables and levels of vitamin D admitted from March to August
#
Onwuneme et al 2015	
Cohort, (single centre) 	n= 120
less than 12 years old with suspected sepsis admitted to the PICU from January 2012 to December 2013
Control group: n= 30 (no sepsis) Subjects 12 years of age admitted for elective day case surgery 
#
Hebbar et al 2014	
Cohort,(single centre) 	n= 61
0 to 18 years of admitted to the PICU from January 2010 until March 2012 
Control group: n= 46 children in the magnetic resonance imaging suite
#
Korwutthikulrangsri et al 2015	
Cohort, (single centre) 	n= 32 between March 2007 and February 2008
Control group: n= 36 healthy children (enrolled during same period)

so why all above cohort..? ? :/ 
#
But then identified the following as case-control:
#
-Wayse et al 2004
Case control, (single centre)	
n= 80 (cases: severe ALRI)
n= 70 (controls, healthy children attending outpatients’ service for immunization) May-June 2002 
#
-Karatekin et al 2009 	
Case control, (single centre) 	
n= 25 (newborns with ALRI) admitted to neonatal intensive care unit 
control group: n= 15 (healthy, age matched with study group. Come to outpatients service for immunization) January-April 2005 
#
-McNally et al 2009 	
Case control, (single centre)  	n= 105 (children younger than 5 years with ALRI); 99 (of the 105) children had adequate serum samples collected 
Control group: n= 92 (no respiratory symptoms but receiving care at the hospital’s ambulatory, emergency or in-patient clinics) 76 (of the 92) control children had adequate serum samples collected 
November 2007 to May 2008.
#
-Roth et al 2009	
Case control, (single centre)  	n= 64 (cases aged 1-25 months admitted with ALRI) 
Control group: n= 65 (aged 1-25 months undergoing elective surgery, no history of hospitalization for ALRI)
From 1st January to 31 March 2005 and 2006 
#
Roth et al 2010 	
Case control, (single centre)  
n= 25 (cases, aged 1 – 23 months admitted for ALRI) 
n= 25 (controls, unlikely to have had recent or severe ALRI; selected by population based sampling. By household census in the village in which was the same of the case participants) 
January to February 2008

Journal of Critical Care 
Their objective was to investigate if supplementation of vitamin D reduces mortality in critically ill patients.
Concl: "Vd supplementation in critically ill patients might be associated with a reduction in mortality without significant adverse effects. 
-->large multicener RCT should confirm findings"
